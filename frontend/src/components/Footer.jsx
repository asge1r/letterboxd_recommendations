                    A user's "star" ratings are scraped their Letterboxd profile
                    and assigned numerical ratings from 1 to 10 (accounting for
                    half stars). Their ratings are then combined with a sample
                    of ratings from the top 4000 most active users on the site
                    to create a collaborative filtering recommender model using
                    singular value decomposition (SVD). All movies in the full
                    dataset that the user has not rated are run through the
                    model for predicted scores and the items with the top
                    predicted scores are returned. Due to constraints in time
                    and computing power, the maxiumum sample size that a user is
                    allowed to select is 500,000 samples, though there are over
                    five million ratings in the full dataset from the top 4000
                    Letterboxd users alone.

                    The underlying model is completely blind to genres, themes,
                    directors, cast, or any other content information; it
                    recommends only based on similarities in rating patterns
                    between other users and movies. I've found that it tends to
                    recommend very popular movies often, regardless of an
                    individual user's taste ("basically everyone who watches 12
                    Angry Men seems to like it, so why wouldn't you?"). To help
                    counteract that, I included a popularity filter that filters
                    by how many times a movie has been rated in the dataset, so
                    that users can specifically find more obscure
                    recommendations. I've also found that it occasionally just
                    completely whiffs (I guess most people who watch "Taylor
                    Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour" do like it, but it's not
                    really my thing). I think that's just the nature of the
                    beast, to some extent, particularly when working with a
                    relatively small sample. It'll return 50 recommendations and
                    that's usually enough to work with if I'm looking for
                    something to watch, even if there are a couple misses here
                    or there.
